# ViperEngine
A lightweight game framework in active development, hopefully, to be used in a small top-down perspective 2d game. Here's the Trello if you want to see what I'm working on and what's next. https://trello.com/b/vvZexWXX/viper-engine-framework


This is just a project that I plan on doing in my downtime, I'm taking a break from video games in general and am just focusing on school and coding for fun.

**Basic Project info and why it exists:**

After this project is in a more finished state, so after Animation and lighting and other important missing features that aren't already in active development are done I will start
working on a small multiplayer top-down survivor game with an emphasis on tech. The reason I'm not just using any other engine like libgdx or slick or jme3 etc. Is that I feel like those
engines are bloated and some just don't contain what I want them to contain. I understand they're open source but I don't like to rummage around in repositories that people have made a mess
of. 

**The game I plan on making in the future with the engine:**

As for the game in a bit more detail, it will be a top-down 2d survival game with procedural generation. You will be able to explore, gather resources, and craft. Similar to Minecraft but 2d.
But there will be a much bigger focus on technology. You will be able to automate a lot of mundane tasks and just create a lot of cool complex stuff. I'll achieve this by giving the player access to
a wiring system with memory circuits and just a lot of cool stuff and ways to interact with the world. And to keep it from getting stale I'll add a whole bunch of content in terms of dimensions.
Items to gather, and more.

**Plans for future of project:**

I don't really know exactly what will happen with it in the future. Likely It will be dropped and I'll just stop coding altogether. But, hopefully, that happens far later in the future.
I will end up doing all of the features currently on my Trello except for the 3 in light green, light green labels just mean that they're not necessary but would be nice to have.
Not sure what the license will be. I'll probably end up picking the one that says do anything except sue me and say it's yours. Though I don't understand why anyone will ever choose this
engine over any other larger one like the ones mentioned earlier. There are plans for documentation in the future when it has more features to... document.

So yea, this is essentially a passion project that probably won't go anywhere but I'll be damned if I don't have fun doing it. Trello below:
